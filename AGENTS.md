# Agent Guidance

Agents working on this project **must**:

- Look for **work instructions and rules** in the directory:  
  `./.agents/rules`

- Look for available **agent skills** in:  
  `./.skills` — internal project skills (e.g. `dashboard-pre-merge-qa`, run it before any merge to `main`)  
  `./.claude/skills` — community skills installed with `npx skills add` (pinned in `skills-lock.json`)

- Look for the **project memory bank** in:  
  `./memory-bank`  
  _(if the directory exists)_

Before taking action (analyzing code, modifying files, or generating outputs), always review the latest files in these locations to ensure compliance with project conventions, context, and operational constraints.
